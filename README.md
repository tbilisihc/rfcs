# Tbilisi Hack Club RFCs

Welcome to the Tbilisi Hack Club's "Request for Comments" (RFC) repository!

## What is an RFC?

An RFC is a document where a club member can propose a new idea for our club. This could be anything:

- A new coding project we should build together.
- An idea for an event, like a workshop or a show-and-tell day.
- A change to how our club operates.
- A proposal for a new club mascot!

The goal is to write down the idea in a clear way so everyone can understand it, discuss it, and decide together if we should do it.

## The RFC Process

1.  **Get an Idea:** You have an idea you want to share with the club.
2.  **Fork the Repo:** Create your own copy of this repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button.
3.  **Create Your RFC:**
    - In your forked repository, copy the `0000-template.md` file.
    - Rename it with the next number in the sequence and a short, descriptive name. For example, if the last RFC was `0002-something`, your new file would be `0003-my-new-idea.md`.
    - Edit your new file and fill out the sections. Don't worry about getting it perfect!
4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Create a "Pull Request" to merge your new RFC file into the main `tbilisi-hack-club/rfcs` repository. This is how you officially present your idea.
5.  **Discussion:** We will discuss your idea in the comments of your Pull Request. This is where we can ask questions, suggest changes, and show our support.
6.  **Decision:** After discussion, the club leaders will decide whether to `approve` or `reject` the RFC. Once a decision is made, the Pull Request will be merged.

## RFC Statuses

- **Draft:** The initial state of an RFC in a Pull Request.
- **In Review:** The idea is being actively discussed.
- **Approved:** The club has decided to move forward with the idea!
- **Rejected:** The club has decided not to move forward with the idea at this time.
- **Implemented:** The idea has been successfully completed.

Let's build amazing things together!
