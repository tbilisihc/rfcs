# Tbilisi Hack Club RFCs

Welcome to the Tbilisi Hack Club's "Request for Comments" (RFC) repository!

## What is an RFC?

An RFC is a document where a club member can propose a new idea for our club. This could be anything:

- A new coding project we should build together.
- An idea for an event, like a workshop or a show-and-tell day.
- A change to how our club operates.
- A proposal for a new club mascot!

The goal is to write down the idea in a clear way so everyone can understand it, discuss it, and decide together if we should do it.

## The RFC Process

1.  **Get an Idea:** You have an idea you want to share with the club.
2.  **Fork the Repo:** Create your own copy of this repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button.
3.  **Create Your RFC:**
    - In your forked repository, copy the `0000-template.md` file.
    - Rename it with the next number in the sequence and a short, descriptive name. For example, if the last RFC was `0002-something`, your new file would be `0003-my-new-idea.md`.
    - Edit your new file and fill out the sections. Don't worry about getting it perfect!
4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Create a "Pull Request" to merge your new RFC file into the main `tbilisi-hack-club/rfcs` repository. This is how you officially present your idea.
5.  **Discussion:** We will discuss your idea in the comments of your Pull Request. This is where we can ask questions, suggest changes, and show our support.
6.  **Decision:** After discussion, the club leaders will decide whether to `approve` or `reject` the RFC. Once a decision is made, the Pull Request will be merged.

## RFC Statuses

- **Draft:** The initial state of an RFC in a Pull Request.
- **In Review:** The idea is being actively discussed.
- **Approved:** The club has decided to move forward with the idea!
- **Rejected:** The club has decided not to move forward with the idea at this time.
- **Implemented:** The idea has been successfully completed.

Let's build amazing things together!

# 0001 - Propose a Club Mascot

- **Author(s):** [Example Author](https://github.com/georgian-hacker)
- **Status:** Approved

## Summary

This RFC proposes that the Tbilisi Hack Club should adopt an official mascot. A mascot would give our club a fun identity, be great for stickers and t-shirts, and make our club more recognizable. My proposal is for the mascot to be a "Capra," a species of wild mountain goat found in the Caucasus mountains, holding a laptop.

## Motivation

Our club is growing, and having a mascot would help build a stronger sense of community. When we go to events or post projects online, our mascot can be our symbol. New members will feel more welcome, and it's a fun creative project for us to design it. The Capra is a strong, agile animal native to Georgia, which represents our ability to tackle tough coding challenges.

## Detailed Design

1.  **Mascot Concept:** A Caucasian mountain goat (Capra caucasica).
2.  **Style:** The style should be friendly and simple, like a cartoon character. It could be similar to the GitHub Octocat or the Go Gopher.
3.  **Key Elements:**
    - The goat should look curious and smart.
    - It should be interacting with technology, maybe holding a small laptop or wearing glasses.
    - The color scheme should incorporate colors from the Georgian flag.
4.  **Action Plan:**
    - **Phase 1: Design Contest.** We will announce a contest for all club members to submit their design ideas for the Capra mascot.
    - **Phase 2: Club Vote.** We will hold a vote to choose the winning design.
    - **Phase 3: Final Artwork.** We can ask a member with strong design skills or find a local artist to create a polished, digital version of the winning design in SVG format.

## Drawbacks

- It might take time away from our coding projects.
- Members might disagree on the final design, which could be disappointing for some.

## Alternatives

- **No Mascot:** We could just continue using a simple logo. This is easier but less fun.
- **Different Animal:** We could choose another animal, like a Svaneti Mastiff or a Caucasian Salamander. However, the goat feels more connected to the idea of "climbing" and overcoming challenges.
- **Abstract Symbol:** We could create an abstract logo, but an animal is more personal and mascot-like.

## Unresolved Questions

- Who will be responsible for organizing the design contest and the vote?
- Do we have a small budget if we need to pay a designer for the final version?
