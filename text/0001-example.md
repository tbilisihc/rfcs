## Summary

This RFC proposes that the Tbilisi Hack Club should adopt an official mascot. A mascot would give our club a fun identity, be great for stickers and t-shirts, and make our club more recognizable. My proposal is for the mascot to be a "Capra," a species of wild mountain goat found in the Caucasus mountains, holding a laptop.

## Motivation

Our club is growing, and having a mascot would help build a stronger sense of community. When we go to events or post projects online, our mascot can be our symbol. New members will feel more welcome, and it's a fun creative project for us to design it. The Capra is a strong, agile animal native to Georgia, which represents our ability to tackle tough coding challenges.

## Detailed Design

1.  **Mascot Concept:** A Caucasian mountain goat (Capra caucasica).
2.  **Style:** The style should be friendly and simple, like a cartoon character. It could be similar to the GitHub Octocat or the Go Gopher.
3.  **Key Elements:**
    - The goat should look curious and smart.
    - It should be interacting with technology, maybe holding a small laptop or wearing glasses.
    - The color scheme should incorporate colors from the Georgian flag.
4.  **Action Plan:**
    - **Phase 1: Design Contest.** We will announce a contest for all club members to submit their design ideas for the Capra mascot.
    - **Phase 2: Club Vote.** We will hold a vote to choose the winning design.
    - **Phase 3: Final Artwork.** We can ask a member with strong design skills or find a local artist to create a polished, digital version of the winning design in SVG format.

## Drawbacks

- It might take time away from our coding projects.
- Members might disagree on the final design, which could be disappointing for some.

## Alternatives

- **No Mascot:** We could just continue using a simple logo. This is easier but less fun.
- **Different Animal:** We could choose another animal, like a Svaneti Mastiff or a Caucasian Salamander. However, the goat feels more connected to the idea of "climbing" and overcoming challenges.
- **Abstract Symbol:** We could create an abstract logo, but an animal is more personal and mascot-like.

## Unresolved Questions

- Who will be responsible for organizing the design contest and the vote?
- Do we have a small budget if we need to pay a designer for the final version?
